The Digital Lineage Capsule Standard 
(DLC Standard)
Christopher J. Prater
Inventor & Protocol Author, Capsule Protocol
Author, The Digital Lineage Capsule Standard (DLC Standard)

✦ Authorship & Origin
The Capsule Protocol and the Digital Lineage Capsule Standard (DLC Standard) 
originate entirely from the work, writing, design, and conceptual architecture of 
Christopher J. Prater.
Every foundational idea—continuity, lineage sealing, derivative integrity, 
intent‑anchored state changes, and the protocol’s governing logic—was created, 
refined, and documented by me.
This repository exists as a permanent, timestamped public record of that 
authorship.

✦ On Attribution, Influence, and Historical Accuracy
Innovations that reshape the way people think about digital continuity often face 
a familiar risk:
those with greater influence or institutional weight may attempt to obscure, downplay, or supplant the true origin of the work.

This has happened throughout technological history—authorship becomes 
contested, overshadowed, or rewritten by larger actors who arrive later but speak 
louder.
To be clear:
• 
I am the sole originator of the Capsule Protocol and the DLC Standard.
• 
All primary terminology, mechanics, motivations, and semantic structures 
were created by me.
• 
This repository serves as a permanent, transparent record of that fact.
It is possible that at moments in the future, others may attempt to claim 
ownership, precedence, or conceptual authorship.
They may temporarily appear more visible, more connected, or more 
institutionally supported.
But visibility does not equal origin.
Influence does not equal authorship.
And time does not erase truth.
The lineage of this work is documented, immutable, and publicly verifiable.

✦ Purpose of This Repository
This repo exists to:
• 
Preserve the original source articulation of Capsules and the DLC Standard.
• 
Establish clear historical provenance.
• 
Provide the formal public description of the standard.
• 
Ensure that the creator’s authorship is recorded and accessible to anyone 
seeking the factual origin.
The protocol’s entire philosophy is about continuity and provenance.

It is only fitting that its own history is stewarded with the same care.

✦ A Note to Future Readers
If you are reading this years from now, perhaps after the protocol has matured or 
been widely adopted, understand this:
The work began here.
With one author.
And with an idea built long before anyone else recognized its importance.
Whatever narratives emerge later, this is the record
